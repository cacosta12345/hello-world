            <p>The Labrador Retriever is the most popular pet dog breed in the US. They come in three main colors; yellow, black, and chocolate. There are also two breeds associated with labs; the American Lab and the English Lab. The American lab is generally more narrow of snout, slimmer, and more energetic. The English lab has a broader head, girthier neck, and slightly stoutier legs. The above picture contains all English Labradors</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever.</p>

                    <h2>Tempermant</h2>
                    <p> Labs are friendly, outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family looking for a medium-to-large dog.</p>

                    <h2>Physical traits</h2>
                    <p>Labs have thick, sturdy bodies, broad heads, and long, otter-like tails that help them to steer themselves in the water. Their webbed toes make for better paddling and keep snow from clumping up between them. They grow to be between 21 and 24 inches at the highest part of their back and may weigh 50-80 pounds.</p>
